The Subdivision Randomizer

I was working a hybrid job in the city while living in the suburbs of a metropolis. 
Those commutes were an hour-long trip through roundabout suburban hell. Through new, 
ridiculously-named subdivisions spanning the horizon. Ostentatious!

I scoffed and then decided to do something about it; mock them. I then filled a table
with as many gaudy and lauded names I could muster. Over years the list grew, never
short of inspiration given the rapid suburban development in the rustbelt. 

My inspiration has now culminated in an array displayed here as the Subdivision Randomizer. 

Enjoy!
